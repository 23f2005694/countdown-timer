# Auto-generated README (Round 2)

**Project brief:** Enhance the countdown timer to support multiple timers. Users should be able to create multiple countdown timers, each with its own input fields for minutes and seconds, and individual Start, Pause, and Reset buttons. Each timer should run independently and display its remaining time in MM:SS format. Maintain the existing progress bar and alert/sound features per timer.

**Attachments:**


**Checks to meet:**
Users can create multiple timers
Each timer operates independently
Each timer has Start, Pause, and Reset buttons
Progress bar and alert work for every timer
Display remains organized and user-friendly

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. No build steps required.
